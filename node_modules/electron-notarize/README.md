```

## What is app "notarization"?

From apple's docs, the definition of a "notarized app"

> A notarized app is a macOS app that was uploaded to Apple for processing before it was distributed. When you export a notarized app from Xcode, it code signs the app with a Developer ID certificate and staples a ticket from Apple to the app. The ticket confirms that you previously uploaded the app to Apple.

> On macOS 10.14 and later, the user can launch notarized apps when Gatekeeper is enabled. When the user first launches a notarized app, Gatekeeper looks for the app’s ticket online. If the user is offline, Gatekeeper looks for the ticket that was stapled to the app.

Basically Apple are going to make this a hard requirement soon, may as well get
on the train early.

## API

### Method: `notarize(opts): Promise<void>`

* `options` Object
  * `appBundleId` String - The app bundle identifier your Electron app is using.  E.g. `com.github.electron`
  * `appPath` String - The absolute path to your `.app` file
  * `ascProvider` String (optional) - Your [Team Short Name](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/113798). This is necessary if you are part of multiple teams, you can find it out by running `iTMSTransporter -m provider -u APPLE_DEV_ACCOUNT -p APP_PASSWORD`
  * There are two methods available: user name with password:
    * `appleId` String - The username of your apple developer account
    * `appleIdPassword` String - The password for your apple developer account
  * ... or apiKey with apiIssuer:
    * `appleApiKey` String - Required for JWT authentication. See Note on JWT authentication below.
    * `appleApiIssuer` String - Issuer ID. Required if `appleApiKey` is specified.

#### Prerequisites

For notarization, you need the following things:

1. Xcode 10 or later installed on your Mac.
2. An [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) account.
3. [An app-specific password for your ADC account’s Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/HT204397).
4. Your app may need to be signed with hardened-runtime and the following entitlements:
    1. com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit
    1. com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory

#### Safety when using `appleIdPassword`

1. Never hard code your password into your packaging scripts, use an environment
variable at a minimum.
2. It is possible to provide a keychain reference instead of your actual password (assuming that you have already logged into
the Application Loader from Xcode).  For example:

```js
const password = `@keychain:"Application Loader: ${appleId}"`;
```

Another option is that you can add a new keychain item using either the Keychain Access app or from the command line using the `security` utility: 

```shell
security add-generic-password -a "AC_USERNAME" -w <app_specific_password> -s "AC_PASSWORD"
```
where `AC_USERNAME` should be replaced with your Apple ID, and then in your code you can use:

```js
const password = `@keychain:AC_PASSWORD`;
```

#### Notes on JWT authentication

You can obtain an API key from [Appstore Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api). Create a key with _App Manager_ access. Note down the Issuer ID and download the `.p8` file. This file is your Api key and comes with the name of `AuthKey_<api_key>.p8`. This is the string you have to supply when calling `notarize`.

Based on the `ApiKey` `altool` will look in the following places for that file:  
`./private_keys`, `~/private_keys`, `~/.private_keys` and `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys`.

#### Example Usage

```js
import { notarize } from 'electron-notarize';

async function packageTask () {
  // Package your app here, and code side with hardened runtime
  await notarize({
    appBundleId,
    appPath,
    appleId,
    appleIdPassword,
    ascProvider, // This parameter is optional
  });
}
```
